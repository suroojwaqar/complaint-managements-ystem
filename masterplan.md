# Complaint Management System - Master Plan

## 1. App Overview and Objectives

### Purpose
A structured complaint handling system that enables efficient tracking, assignment, and resolution of client complaints with a clear workflow and role-based permissions.

### Core Objectives
- Streamline the complaint management process
- Ensure accountability through defined roles and workflows
- Provide transparency to clients about complaint status
- Enable cross-departmental collaboration with appropriate controls
- Deliver timely notifications to all stakeholders
- Create a centralized system for tracking and managing complaints

## 2. Target Audience
- **Clients**: Users who submit complaints
- **Employees**: Front-line staff who handle complaints
- **Managers**: Department leaders who oversee complaint resolution
- **Administrators**: System administrators who manage users and settings

## 3. Core Features and Functionality

### Complaint Submission and Tracking
- Client complaint submission form with error type and error screen fields
- File attachment support for screenshots or supporting evidence
- Automatic assignment to default employees
- Status tracking through defined workflow stages
- Client portal for viewing complaint history and status

### Role-Based Assignment System
- Automated initial assignment
- Cross-department escalation via managers only
- Manager-to-team assignment within departments
- Final verification by initial assignee

### Notification System
- Email notifications at each status change
- WhatsApp integration using waapi.app API
- Notification templates for different status updates

### User Management
- Single login portal with role-based permissions
- User account creation by administrators only
- Department and role assignment

### Workflow Enforcement
- Status progression: New → Assigned → In Progress → Completed → Done → Closed
- Role-based restrictions on assignment actions
- Managers can only assign within their team
- Employees can only escalate to managers of other departments

### File Management
- Attachment support for complaints (photos, documents, etc.)
- Secure storage and retrieval of attachments

## 4. High-Level Technical Stack

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Next.js
  - *Pros*: Server-side rendering, optimized performance, excellent developer experience
  - *Cons*: Potential learning curve for developers new to React/Next.js
- **UI Components**: Material UI or Tailwind CSS
  - *Recommendation*: Tailwind CSS for faster development and customization
- **State Management**: React Context API with hooks
  - *Recommendation*: Simple and effective for this scale of application

### Backend
- **Framework**: Next.js API routes
  - *Pros*: Unified codebase, simplified deployment
  - *Cons*: May need to separate backend for very large scale
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js
  - *Pros*: Easy integration with Next.js, supports multiple providers
  - *Cons*: Some customization may be required for role-based permissions

### Database
- **Primary Database**: MongoDB
  - *Pros*: Flexible schema, good for document-oriented data like complaints
  - *Cons*: Requires careful schema design for relational data

### Storage
- **File Storage**: AWS S3 or similar cloud storage
  - *Pros*: Scalable, reliable, and cost-effective
  - *Cons*: Additional integration required

### External Integrations
- **Email Service**: SendGrid or similar
  - *Pros*: Reliable delivery, templates, tracking
  - *Cons*: Requires API integration
- **WhatsApp**: waapi.app API
  - *Pros*: Direct integration with WhatsApp for notifications
  - *Cons*: Potential rate limiting, requires proper error handling
