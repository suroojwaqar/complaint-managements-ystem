# WhatsApp Integration with WAAPI

This document explains the WhatsApp integration setup and usage for the Complaint Management System using WAAPI.

## Overview

The system automatically sends WhatsApp notifications for all complaint-related events:
- âœ… New complaint created
- âœ… Complaint assigned/reassigned  
- âœ… Status changes
- âœ… Comments added

## Setup Instructions

2. Create an account and purchase a subscription plan
3. Create a new WhatsApp instance
4. Get your Instance ID and API Key from the dashboard

### 2. Environment Configuration

```env

WAAPI_INSTANCE_ID=your_instance_id_here

WAAPI_BASE_URL=https://waapi.app/api/v1
```

### 3. WhatsApp Instance Setup

1. Log into your WAAPI dashboard
2. Connect your WhatsApp account to the instance
3. Ensure the instance status shows as "Connected"
4. Test the connection using the admin settings panel

## Phone Number Format

The system automatically formats phone numbers:
- Supports Pakistani numbers: `03001234567` â†’ `923001234567@c.us`

## API Endpoints

### Test Connection
```http
GET /api/whatsapp/test
Authorization: Admin only
```

### Send Test Message
```http
POST /api/whatsapp/test
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Admin only

{
  "phone": "923001234567",
  "message": "Test message"
}
```

### Get Settings
```http
GET /api/whatsapp/settings
Authorization: Admin only
```

## Admin Panel Features

Access via `/admin/settings/whatsapp`:

1. **Configuration Status** - Shows if WhatsApp API is properly configured
2. **Connection Test** - Test API connectivity
3. **Send Test Message** - Send test notification to verify setup
4. **Environment Setup Guide** - Instructions for configuration

## Error Handling

- Notifications are sent asynchronously and won't block main operations
- Failed notifications are logged but don't affect complaint processing
- System gracefully handles API rate limits with 1-second delays
- Invalid phone numbers are filtered out automatically

## Rate Limiting

- 1-second delay between messages to avoid rate limits
- Background processing prevents API delays from affecting user experience
- Failed messages are logged for monitoring

## Message Templates

```

*ID:* #ABC123

## Security Considerations

- API keys are masked in admin interface (show only last 4 characters)
- Phone numbers are validated and sanitized
- Rate limiting prevents API abuse
- Environment variables keep credentials secure

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Messages not sending**
   - Check WAAPI instance connection status
   - Verify API credentials in environment variables
   - Ensure phone numbers are in correct format
   - Check WAAPI account balance/subscription

2. **Invalid phone numbers**
   - System filters out empty/invalid numbers
   - Check user profile phone number format
   - Verify country code handling

3. **API errors**
   - Check WAAPI dashboard for instance status
   - Verify API key permissions
   - Monitor rate limit status

### Testing

1. Use admin panel test feature
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Monitor server logs for WhatsApp service messages
4. Verify WAAPI dashboard delivery status
