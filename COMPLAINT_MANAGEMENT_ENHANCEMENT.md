3. Click "Bulk Actions" dropdown
4. Choose from:
   - **Status Updates**: Mark selected complaints as Assigned, In Progress, Completed, or Closed

- ✅ Automatic cleanup of related complaint history

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
```javascript
const [selectedComplaints, setSelectedComplaints] = useState<Set<string>>(new Set());
const [isDeleting, setIsDeleting] = useState(false);
const [deleteDialogOpen, setDeleteDialogOpen] = useState(false);
const [bulkDeleteDialogOpen, setBulkDeleteDialogOpen] = useState(false);
```

### Bulk API Usage
```javascript
const response = await fetch('/api/complaints/bulk', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    action: 'delete', // or 'updateStatus', 'export'
    complaintIds: Array.from(selectedComplaints),
    newStatus: 'Completed' // for status updates
  })
});
```

### Role-based UI
```javascript
{session?.user?.role === 'admin' && (
  <Checkbox
    checked={isSelected}
    onCheckedChange={(checked) => handleSelectComplaint(complaint._id, checked)}
  />
)}
```

## Mobile Responsive Design

- **Desktop**: Table view with checkboxes and action buttons
- **Mobile**: Card view with inline checkboxes and actions
- Both views support selection and bulk operations
- Consistent UX across devices

## Future Enhancements

### Suggested Improvements

5. **Export Formats**: Support CSV, PDF export in addition to JSON
6. **Audit Trail**: Enhanced tracking of bulk operations
7. **Undo Functionality**: Ability to undo recent bulk operations
8. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Quick selection and bulk actions

### Performance Optimizations
