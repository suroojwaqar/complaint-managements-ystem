# Select Component Fix Summary

## Problem
The error "A <Select.Item /> must have a value prop that is not an empty string" was occurring because we had SelectItem components with empty string values like:

```tsx
<SelectItem value="">All Roles</SelectItem>
```

## Solution
1. **Replace empty strings with meaningful values**:
   ```tsx
   <SelectItem value="all">All Roles</SelectItem>
   ```

2. **Update initial state**:
   ```tsx
   const [roleFilter, setRoleFilter] = useState('all');
   ```

3. **Update filter logic**:
   ```tsx
   if (roleFilter && roleFilter !== 'all') {
     // Apply filter
   }
   ```

## Files Fixed
- ✅ `/admin/users/page.tsx` - Role and Status filters
- ✅ `/admin/complaints/page.tsx` - Status and Department filters
- ✅ Form components already had proper values

## Result
- No more Select component errors
- Filters work correctly with "All" options
- Better semantic meaning with "all" instead of empty strings

## Testing
After applying these fixes, the Select components should work without runtime errors. The "All" options now have meaningful values instead of empty strings, which satisfies the Radix UI Select requirements.
